# Build a Portfolio Project

This repository contains the submission for the first project in the Udacity **Front-End Web Developer** nanodegree course.

HTML file is **demo.html** and the CSS file is **demo.css**.  The **images** directory contains the images.  

Preview at http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/WeaselGizzard/project/blob/master/demo.html  or view at http://anesi.com/project/demo.html

The major goal was to produce something that looked like the design mockup, but with different images (though preserving aspect ratio and layout), and that would be adaptive to various device types, for which purpose a _flexbox_ layout was employed.

The HTML and CSS code have been validated against the W3C validation services.

Appearance and function have been tested on IE, Chrome, and Firefox browsers on a Windows laptop; using the device emulators in Chrome; and on my iPhone 6s.
 
My reasons for taking this course:

- Get a good, coherent view of modern web development.
- Understand the developer tools now in common use.
- Upgrade my personal web site, http://anesi.com, which dates to 1995, to modern standards.
